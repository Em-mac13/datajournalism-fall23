## Clarity and Accuracy
Central Insight Identification: 4
* Despite an alarming increase in student seclusion reports in the Cedrar Rapids and Iowa City school districts, the content and reasoning behind the student seclusion have been made unavailable to the public, following a 2016 court overturn. 
This is sort of included in the headline; it is mentioned that the seclusion reports aren’t being made available, but the increase in seclusions and physical restraints are brought up in the lede. 
Data Visualization: N/A
Data Accuracy: 3
* It’s not so much inaccuracy as a problem of not enough information, at this point. The central problem is that the public is unable to view the reports, but they still know about the increase in reports — we’re they only able to view or learn about the existence reports? Where did that information come from? In another part, the Iowa City school district comes under fire for not releasing their seclusion reports in either content or numbers. But a few paragraphs down, the paper says that after a prior investigation on this topic, Iowa City removed its seclusion rooms already — which leaves me wondering what the seclusion situation they’re dealing with in Iowa City schools looks like now. 
There’s an entire paragraph dedicated to talking about teachers facing violence from students, but no comments from teachers. I know this article puts educators in a bit of a hard place, but I think it would be worth it to talk to teachers about anything they’re seeing in their classes that might have contributed to the influx in reports, and thoughts on not disclosing the reports. 
Not directly. They say the reports exist, there’s been an increase in restraint and inclusion, and the school districts won’t release the information. 
## Quality
Story Quality: 3
* I think this is a really good foundation for a story, and it certainly seems like three e is a significant issue here, but as highlighted in the accuracy section, I feel there are some places that could have been better fleshed out and gaps in some of the information.  Mainly, I would like to know where the reporter got the numbers for the Cedar Rapids School district reports. 
## Creativity
Creative elements: 3
* It’s a fairly standard story, with little in the way of extra bells and whistles. There’s no graphic, no other visual elements outside of the lead photos — which granted, the padded seclusion room definitely stuck with me. Still, the informational gaps notwithstanding, I’d say it’s mostly well-written and makes good use of hyperlinks.
