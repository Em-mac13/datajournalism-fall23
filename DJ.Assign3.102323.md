   ### Link to the original dataset
[Recidivism of Prisoners Released in 24 States in 2008: A 10-Year Follow-Up Period, 2008â€“2018] 
(https://bjs.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh236/files/media/document/rpr24s0810yfup0818.zip)
I chose to look at Appendix Table 3. Standard errors for table 5: Cumulative percent of state prisoners released in 24 states in 2008 who were arrested following release, by most serious commitment offense, type of prison admission, and year following release
   
   ### Any steps you need to take to clean it
1) I started by adding an additional column that broke down the types of crime by category, (violent, property, etc.), then I put all the crimes into a singular column. 
2) Next I moved on to the numbers and added columns to total the number of repeat offenses using a simple formula. I'm honestly not sure if I did this right. 

   ### What is the interesting question you are answering?
I wanted to see where the highest numbers for recidivism were by category, and which crimes resulted in the highest recidivism rates. I wanted to look at all 10 years, but I also didn't think the numbers were lining up correctly with the totals being in the pivot table. 
  
   ### What is the answer to the question?
Violent crime had the highest recidivism rate as an overall category, and "other violence" was the individual crime most likely to be repeated, with assault following as a near second.
