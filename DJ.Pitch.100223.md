## BACKGROUND: 

Of a current list of felony domestic assault cases reported on by a local paper across three southwest Minnesota counties, the majority of cases end in either dismissal or probation only for convicted parties, often recommending participation in a rehabilitation-type program. The state of Minnesota overall has a preference for probational sentencing, with an overwhelming percentage of individuals in the legal system under community supervision. During its 2023 session, a bill passed altering the state sentencing guideline for a recommendation to reduce sentences, contingent on participation in rehabilitation programs. However, an overview of rehabilitation programs focused on intimate partner violence in Minnesota has shown limited success.

There are three potentially interesting lines of questions that arise from this: 
1. Prior to the 2023 change, how often do domestic assault cases in Minnesota end in dismissals or probation only? 
2. How often do individuals convicted of domestic assault receive repeat or additional charges, such as DANCO violations?
3. What are the success rates for IPV rehabilitation programs in Minnesota, and how will programs be implemented across the state in light of the 2023 sentencing changes?

## DATA: 
Minnesota has an open, searchable database of cases. Using either a name or case number, it’s easy to locate cases and determine the charges involved and the conclusion. I currently have a self-made database from my time as a local crime reporter, including information on every domestic assault case I covered across six counties.  
Using FOIAs to request case numbers for cases involving domestic assault from local law enforcement offices or the county attorney’s office, this database could be updated and expanded. Once you have the name and number, it’s fairly easy to look at an individual's history. Additionally, the Bureau of Statistics reportedly keeps records of state-by-state recidivism rates across the country, which could provide additional context. 
In 2018, the Minnesota Department of Corrections published a plan for reducing recidivism, which included information on rehabilitation programs. The following year, a study was released evaluating the effectiveness of standing and pilot programs aimed at decreasing IPV. There is data existing on this topic, and talking to experts like Susan McNeeley, who authored the 2019 study, on where those programs and their effectiveness stand now would be beneficial.
