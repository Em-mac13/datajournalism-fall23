# Steps to Analyzing Data
Finding the sort of data I wanted for this project, particularly in terms of raw data was difficult, to say the least. While I initially hoped to look at dismissal and probation-only conviction rates in the State of Minnesota, likeliness of recidivism, and rehabilitation program participation, it quickly became apparent that the data I wanted wasn’t available. Specific to Minnesota, I couldn't locate domestic violence case dismissals rates or probation-only conviction rates in cases of domestic violence. In general, it was difficult to find Minnesota-specific data, any data related to dismissal rates, and IPV rehabilitation participation rates or program availability.  
## Recidivism
I did find a U.S. ten-year recidivism study taking into account data from 24 states, including a data breakdown which I was able to pull offense types and the recidivism rate within that ten-year period and create a table from. In the end, the table I made broke down four “categories'' of crimes, (violent, property, drug, and public order), the actual type of crime (ex.: negligent manslaughter, assault, burglary, etc.), and what percentage of released offenders committed another offense during each year between 2008 and 2018.
Unfortunately, the data grouped various types of assault all under the broad label of assault, so it was impossible to separate out offenses of solely intimate partner violence, based on that set.  
I found multiple studies on the reoffense rate for domestic violence perpetrators, which supported that assault, this time domestic assault specific, had a significant reoffense rate, especially in the context of other violent crimes. However, these studies lacked accessible raw data, but showed a strong methodology for the conclusions provided. 
## Rehabilitation
Having found a lack of data on both Minnesota-based and national participation in IPV rehabilitation programs, I switched gears and began to look at the reported effectiveness of common rehabilitation programs used in the U.S. I was able to find several medical and/or judicial studies reviewing IPV programming. There were two studies in particular that I was able to use for the purposes of creating my own data tables. 
First, the 2021-released Census of State and Federal Adult Correctional Facilities provided data on prisoner participation in special programming offered across state and federal correctional facilities. I was able to simplify this set down to show how many facilities offered specific special programs to prisoners in the first place. 
While it was enlightening, this set provided a significant limitation. The number of corrective domestic violence programs offered in U.S. correctional facilities was so low, it was grouped among the category of “other,” along with, but not limited to, cognitive behavioral therapy, wellness, victim impact, and faith-based programs. It is worth noting that CBT and victim impact programs can fall under the umbrella of IPV programming. 
Secondly, a Washington State Court Research study on domestic violence, sentencing conditions, and recidivism provided some excellent data and was incredibly insightful on the methodology that could be used to derive similar data in Minnesota. Including domestic violence cases filed within a two-year period, the Washington study provided data on the frequency of use, compliance rates, and recidivism rates during a five-year period, based on sentencing types and conditions.  
These data sets require little to no cleaning. I ended up using the numbers in two different charts. All of that said, the study is now nearly 15 years old, having been completed in the late 2010’s. 


# Findings
* Recidivism of Prisoners Released:
  - During a ten-year period, individuals with a prior assault conviction had the highest recidivism rate among violent crimes, outside of individuals convicted of robbery.
  - Public order crimes had the highest reoffense numbers by a significant increase, averaging around 72%. The other three broad categories had similar recidivism rates, all falling approximately in the mid 50’s, on average.
  - Comparatively, individuals with prior assault convictions were rearrested at a rate of 92.5%
* Washington State:
  - Similarly to Minnesota, Washington courts highly favor probation and fines over detention in cases of domestic violence convictions.
  - Probation in Washington has a 32% compliance rate. Participation in domestic violence treatment has a 38% compliance rate.
  - When domestic violence offenders were sentenced with conditions, only 4.1% were required to participate in domestic violence treatment.

  - Domestic violence offenders who participated in treatment were less likely to be reconvicted, though domestic violence-specific treatment still resulted in a higher rate of recidivism (29%) than programming like anger management or victim-oriented treatment.
  - Note: The reoffense rate for individuals participating in domestic violence programming found in the Washington State study is in line with the national reoffense rates found in Development and Validation of a Prediction Tool for Reoffending Risk in Domestic Violence and Correlates of Re-arrest among Felony Domestic Violence Probationers.
  - Combination of jail, probation, and any treatment resulted in the lowest reoffense rates. However, any treatment and jail, and jail and probation had a reoffense rate of 69% and 70%, respectively. Jail-only sentencing resulted in an 83% recidivism rate.

  - A look at Washington’s IPV-related rehabilitation programming shows a modest number of programs, most appearing to follow a CBT model.
* Recidivism Related (various sources):
  - Multiple studies place the likelihood of reoffense for domestic violence offenders in the range of 28-36%.
  - Taking into account instances of IPV that go unreported, the study Development and Validation of a Prediction Tool for Reoffending Risk in Domestic Violence puts the likelihood of IPV recurring at approximately 50% within the first year after release.
  - Risk factors for recurrence include housing access, substance dependence and use, sentencing type, and incompletion of sentencing and conditions, among other factors.
  - Other forms of violent crime, excluding robbery, showed a significantly lower recidivism rate than assault (92%) and domestic assault (approximately 33%) across a ten-year study.
* IPV Rehabilitation Related  (various sources):
- The Duluth Model, rooted in the introduction of anti-patriarchal ideology and community, is considered the leading model of IPV rehabilitation programming. It was developed in Duluth, MN, and is used both nationally and globally.
-  Multiple studies reported a lack of effectiveness of IPV rehabilitation programming, especially when introduced in a prison environment. This included the Duluth model along with some forms of CBT programs.
- A Minnesota analysis of effectiveness in prison-based treatment programming, including the establishment of a Duluth model-style program within prison was found to have no significant reduction in recidivism rates for domestic violence offenders. Some facilities reported an increase in cases of IPV from offenders who had participated in the program.
- Nationally, State and Federal programs failed to offer special programming centering IPV rehabilitation and prevention, with domestic violence programs making up less than 3.5% of offered programming

## Conclusion/Nut Graf 

In the U.S., domestic violence offenders have a significant likelihood of reoffending, above most other types of violent crime. While recidivism rates can be affected by a number of different factors, within the judicial system, effective programming and treatment can reduce the risk of reoffending. However there is a gap in effective IPV rehabilitation programming for people convicted of domestic violence, and where such programming does exist, it’s often under-utilized or likely unable to meet the demands necessary to make a significant impact on domestic violence recidivism rates.

# Future Reporting

If I were going to continue with this story, I would still want to tailor it to Minnesota, as I had initially talked about in my first pitch. Compiling the data would require a lot of legwork, but I do think it’s a subject worth digging into. The recent changes in sentencing guidelines, made in the earlier 2023 legislative session, allow for a decreased sentence in cases where the offender participates in rehabilitation programming. 
With domestic violence an offense with a higher recidivism rate in comparison to other violent crimes, and Minnesota’s own Department of Corrections labeling the primary model used for IPV rehabilitation ineffective, there is a not-unfounded concern that the Minnesota Legislature might be putting the cart before the horse in this case. 
Working as a crime and courts reporter in Southern Minnesota, I have seen first-hand examples of  the failure of Minnesota’s courts to protect victims of domestic violence from repeated offenses, including the inability to enforce penalties for DANCO violations that resulted in new domestic assault charges.  
Additionally, I have spoken with representatives from a local rehabilitative programming organization, who stated that success rates for male-centered IPV rehabilitation was one of the areas where their organization struggled most heavily. 
There are a total of 14 correctional facilities in the state of Minnesota. Continuing with this story, would require submitting FOIA requests related to IPV programming and participation within those facilities. Connecting with Minnesota’s jail system would be a larger workload, but not impossible. 
Additionally, requesting case file numbers including domestic assault charge(s), which should be recorded by County Attorney’s offices, local law offices, or the District Court offices would allow for the building of a database that would provide insight similar to Washington’s study.  Minnesota provides an accessible online court database that can be used to track convictions, dismissals, and repeated offenses, among other things. I used it in the building of my own database to keep track of every crime story I wrote during my time in Minnesota. While the process would be tedious and time-consuming, it’s entirely possible to gain insight into the patterns of recidivism and dismissal for domestic violence cases using this methodology. 
With that data obtained and in the context of the availability and effectiveness of Minnesota’s IPV programming, I think you would have everything necessary for a compelling data story.
